# 🧠 EduSense: Intelligent System for Detecting Student Confusion

**EduSense** is an AI-powered system designed to enhance online learning by detecting student confusion in real time.  
Using computer vision and deep learning, it analyzes facial expressions, gaze direction, and head movements through a webcam to identify moments of confusion during lectures.

When confusion is detected, the system links those moments to lecture timestamps and automatically generates adaptive learning resources — such as summarized notes, interactive quizzes, and runnable Jupyter notebooks for programming content.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Detect student confusion using real-time webcam input.  
- Improve online education by providing adaptive feedback.  
- Develop an interpretable AI model using Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs).  
- Automate personalized learning material generation.
