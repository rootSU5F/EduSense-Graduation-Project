# 🧠 EduSense: Intelligent System for Detecting Student Confusion

EduSense is an academic graduation project aimed at enhancing online learning by detecting student confusion during lectures and organizing project documentation, planning, and research artifacts in a single place.

This repository currently focuses on documentation, planning (Gantt), references, and presentation materials. Implementation artifacts (code) will be added in later phases.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define and document the problem and solution space for student confusion detection.
- Plan milestones and deliverables with a clear Gantt timeline.
- Collect and curate research papers, datasets, and references.
- Prepare presentation materials for checkpoints and final defense.

## 📅 Gantt Chart
- Open `gant.html` directly in your browser to view the interactive Gantt.
- The Gantt reads from `gantt.csv`. To update the plan:
  1. Edit `gantt.csv` (keep the same columns/format).
  2. Refresh `gant.html` in the browser to see changes.

If you move files, update paths in `gant.html` accordingly.

## 📚 Documentation
- Primary documents are under `Docs/`.
- The formal report is available at `Docs/Report/Project Report.pdf`.
- Use `Docs/Chapters/` for incremental chapter drafts (Introduction, Literature Review, Design, etc.).

---

## 🔎 References
All academic, technical, and dataset references are under `References/`. Highlights include recent works on multimodal emotion detection and educational AI systems. See also `References/DataSet.md` for dataset notes when applicable.

---

## 🖥️ Slides
Checkpoint and final presentations are stored under `Slides/`.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (High Level)
1. High-Level Design (HLD): architecture, data flow, and module definitions.
2. Low-Level Design (LLD): detailed module specifications and interfaces.
3. Prototype: minimal confusion-detection pipeline and demo UI.
4. Evaluation: metrics, user study (if applicable), and refinements.
5. Finalization: documentation, slides, and defense preparation.
